# Guessing Game

Guessing Game is a simple number-guessing game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a certain number of attempts. The game is fun, lightweight, and can be played directly in the console.

## How to Play

The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 50. The player has 5 attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game will tell the player whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

If the player guesses the correct number, they win the game. If they don't guess it within 5 tries, the game ends, and the correct number is revealed.

## Installation

You can install the guessing game via `pip` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install guessing_game
